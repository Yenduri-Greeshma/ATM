# ATM Using Python 
Creating an ATM system using Python involves developing a program that simulates the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Here's an overview of the system:

Key Features:
1.User Authentication: Simulate a login system with a card number (or account number) and a PIN. Validate the credentials from a predefined database or data structure.
2.Core Functionalities: Balance Inquiry: Allow the user to check their current account balance. Deposit Money: Enable users to add funds to their account. Withdraw Money: Allow users to withdraw funds, ensuring the balance is sufficient. Fund Transfer: Simulate transferring money to another account. Change PIN: Let the user update their PIN securely. Exit: End the session securely. 
3.Database Management: Store user details (account number, PIN, balance, transaction history) using: Python dictionaries for simple systems. SQLite or CSV files for more realistic use cases.
4.Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs like incorrect PIN or withdrawal exceeding the balance. Provide retry mechanisms for failed actions. 5.User-Friendly Interface: Menu-driven interface for operations. Clear and concise prompts and feedback messages.
